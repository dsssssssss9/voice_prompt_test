i should like to point out that the original code on which my translation is based was written by Thomas Burzy - https: github.com/FireMarshmellow
  
He did all the hard work in translating the not so easy to understand DFRobot manual to somethng much more readable - so he deserves the vast majority of the credit!!
  
He has a very good Youtube channel as well - https: www.youtube.com/mellow_labs
  
   
  
    ******************************************************************************
  
ALSO i had some excellent help from Bill Sievers so he deserves a mention as well!!
